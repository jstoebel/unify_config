# Once configured, you can run the backup with the following command:
#
# $ backup perform -t my_backup [-c <path_to_configuration_file>]

# For more information about Backup's components, see the documentation at:

  # Adding a file or directory (including sub-directories):
  #   archive.add "/path/to/a/file.rb"

  # where `backup perform` is executed, and they will be expanded
  # to the root of the filesystem when added to the archive.

  # given `root` path and will not be expanded when added to the archive.
